#**Summary**

The cf-dotnet-sdk-msbuild-tasks project implements custom tasks that use the cf-dotnet-sdk (https://github.com/hpcloud/cf-dotnet-sdk) to facilitate .NET projects integration with CloudFoundry.

Tasks implemented in this library:
		

 - LoadYaml
	 - allows loading the settings for a manifest yaml file (http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html )
	 - required parameter: path to the manifest file (CFConfigurationFile)
	 - output: application name (CFAppName), path to application's folder (CFAppPath), an array of routes (CFRoutes), application's stack (CFStack), memory limit (CFAppMemory), instances number (CFAppInstances), autoscale information as xml (CFAutoscale) , disk limit (CFDisk), provisioned services information xml (CFServices), placement zone (CFPlacementZone) and single sign on enabled information (CFSsoEnabled)
 - Login 
	 - allows the user to obtain a refresh token from the cloud
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials (CFUser, CFPassword and CFServerUri)

		  </ItemGroup>` 
	 - output: created application's guid (CFAppGuid)
 - PushApp
	 - allows the user to push an application to the cloud
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials, application's guid (CFAppGuid) and the path to the application's folder (CFAppPath)
	 - optional parameters: allow application to start (CFStart - default value is false) 
 - CreateRoutes
	 - allow users to create routes that can be later mapped to an application
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials, an array of routes provided as string or metadata item (CFRoutes) and the space name (CFSpace)
	 - sample CFRoutes definiton as msbuild metadata item
		 - `<ItemGroup>
		  <CFRoutes Include="hostname">
		  <Domain>sampledomain.com</Domain>
		  </CFRoutes>
		  </ItemGroup>`
	 - output: returns a list of route guids
 - BindRoutes
	 - allow users to bind routes to an application
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials, application's guid(CFAppGuid) and an array of route guids (CFRouteGuids)
 - CreateService
	 - allow users to provision a service
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials, service name (CFServiceName), space name (CFSpace), service plan (CFServicePlan) and service type (CFServiceType)
	 - output: returns the provisioned service's guid (CFServiceGuid)
 - CreateServices
	 - allow users to provision a collection of services
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials, services information provided as xml, string or metadata item (CFServices) and space name (CFSpace)
	 - sample CFServices definition as msbuild metadata item:
		 - `<ItemGroup>
		  <CFServices Include="ServiceName">
		  <Type>ServiceType<Type>
		  <Plan>ServicePlan</Plan>
		  </CFServices >
		  </ItemGroup>`
	 - output: returns an array of the provisioned services guids (CFServicesGuids)
 - BindServices
	 - allows users to bind an array of provisioned services to an application
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials, application's guid (CFAppGuid) and an array of service guids (CFServicesGuids)
	 - output: returns an array of binding guids (BindingGuids)
 - DeleteApp
	 - allows user to remove an application from the cloud
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials, application name (CFAppName) and space name (CFSpace)
	 - optional parameters: allow task to delete routes bound to the application (CFDeleteRoutes) and allow task to delete provisioned services bound to the application (CFDeleteServices)
 - DeleteService
	 - allows user to remove a provisioned service instance
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials, provisioned service name (CFServiceName) and space name (CFSpace)
 - DeleteRoute
	 - allows user to remove an unbound route
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials and route (CFRoute)
 - UnbindRoute
	 - allows user to remove a route binding from an application
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials, application name (CFAppName), space name (CFSpace) and route (CFRoute) 
 - UnbindService
	 - allows user to remove a provisioned service binding from an application
	 - required parameters: cloud credentials, application name (CFAppName), space name (CFSpace) and service name (CFServiceName)
 - SaveYaml
	 - allows user to create a manifest yaml file
	 - required parameters: application path (CFAppPath), application name (CFAppName), application's route (CFRoute), instances number (CFAppInstances), memory limit (CFAppMemory), application's stack (CFStack) and configuration file path (CFConfigurationFile)
	 - optional parameters: autoscale information (CFMaxCpu, CFMinCpu, CFEnabled, CFMaxInstances and CFMinInstances), disk limit (CFDisk), placement zone (CFPlacementZone), single sign on enabled (CFSsoEnabled) and service information (CFServiceName, CFServicePlan, CFServiceType)
 
#**Prerequisites**
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
 - .NET Framework 4.5

#**Usage**

In order to use this library it is necessary to map the task that is referenced to the assembly that contains the task implementation (in this case the cf-dotnet-sdk-msbuild-tasks library). This can be done by adding the UsingTask Element in your msbuild project file (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t41tzex2.aspx)

#**Project dependencies**

This library uses Cloud Foundry .NET SDK and YamlDotNet libraries.

#**Building the project**

The solution can be build simply by running `msbuild CloudFoundry.Build.sln`. The build output will be located in the lib folder and the tests are located in lib\tests.

#**Running tests**

Since the unit tests are using fakes the cf-dotnet-sdk-msbuild-tasks project tests can be run only using vstest.console.exe since mstest does not support the fakes framework yet. 

To run the unit tests:
`vstest.console.exe lib\tests\CloudFoundry.Build.Tasks.Test.dll`

To run the integration tests it is necessary to modify the CloudFoundry.Build.Tasks.IntegrationTests.dll.config file and add the credentials and url of the CloudFoundry deployment used for the tests.

To run the integration tests:
`vstest.console.exe lib\tests\CloudFoundry.Build.Tasks.IntegrationTests.dll`



#**Integration with a project**

It is not necessary for the project that will use this library to include a reference to this library. As stated in the usage section this library should be used with a UsingTask Element straight in the project file. 

Sample integration of the create application task in a target of the project file: 

`<Target Name="sampleCreate">
	<UsingTask AssemblyFile="$(SolutionDir)\packages\Cloudfoundry.Build.Tasks.dll" TaskName="CreateApp">
	</UsingTask>
	        <CreateApp CFAppName="sampleApp" CFStack="win2012r2" CFSpace="SampleSpace" CFUser="sampleUser" CFPassword="samplePass" CFServerUri="api.1.2.3.4.xip.io">
    			<Output TaskParameter="CFAppGuid" PropertyName="CFAppGuid"/>
    		</CreateApp>
    </Target>
`

This target can be called using: `msbuild myproject.csproj /t:sampleCreate`

Later CFAppGuid can be used as a parameter for binding tasks.
